# A Simple Web Game

**Warning**: the contents in this tempate are deprected, and will soon be replaced by a much different structure. Volo and several other things will be removed to offer a simpler and more extensible template.

The is a small template that comes with a working game where you can
move the player around. Use this to start your game!

If you look in `www/js/app.js,` you'll see that this comes with a
basic render loop, a player enttiy, and an input library.

This is part of the [mortar](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar/)
template collection for building Open Web Apps.

# Usage

There are a few ways to get this template:

* git clone git@github.com:mozilla/mortar-game-stub.git myapp
* volo create myapp mozilla/mortar-game-stub

If you have node installed, you can run a development server with volo:

* cd myapp
* volo serve

View the game at http://localhost:8008/.
